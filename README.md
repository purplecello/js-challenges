# JS challenges

My solutions for [Brad Traversy JS challenges](https://github.com/bradtraversy/traversy-js-challenges).

Usually the first solution I wrote that worked passed the tests, not necessarily the best one. The repo linked above includes multiple good solutions for each challenge.

I added comments to the challenges I didn't know how to solve and followed along with the videos.
